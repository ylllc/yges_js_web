# Import

## for web

(todo)  

## for Node/Deno

```
import HappeningManager from 'api/happening.js';
```
importing name can redefine in your wish.  

# How to Use

## Listen them

```
// can override common happening management procedure 
HappeningManager.Happened=(h)=>{
	//		: 
	// instant recovery when possible
	// and call h.resolve()
	//		: 
}
```

## Feature side happening and suggestion

```
var h=HappeningManager.happenProp({type:'Test',msg:'Happened'},{
	// user resolving protocol 
	User:{
		retry:()=>{
			// retry procedure 
			//		:
			h.resolve();
		},
		ignore:()=>{
			// ignore procedure 
			//		:
			h.abandon();
		},
	},
	Resolved:()=>{
		// called on resolved 
	},
	Abandoned:()=>{
		// called on abandoned 
	},
});
```

## Polling unresolved

```
HappeningManager.poll((h)=>{
	//		: 
	// user procedure by decision
	//		: 
});
```

## Local Happenning Manager

can create local instance and categorize in your wish.

```
var lhap=HappeningManager.createLocal();
```

## Cleaning up

Resolved instance still kept in HappeningManager and makes it dirty.  
HappeningManager.cleanup() removes resolved and abandoned instances
and makes it clean.  


## Resolved vs Abandoned 

Resolved give priority over Abandoned.  
Resolved instance cannot abandon.  
and Abandoned instance still can resolve and retract abandoned.
